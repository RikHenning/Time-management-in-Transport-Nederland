Hour-Registration
Hour registration in Dutch Logistics

This is part of my learning track of getting to grips with Development.

After some basic skills from HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap I will now attempt to use Vue.js

My everlasting thanks to @Barra66 for his selfless support with my efforts.

Dutch Logistical timetracking is a tricky thing and I used to work with that a lot in my previous job. Checking and filling in by hand multiple paper time slibs of every employee every day. There are a lot of rules involved and the timekeeping means different things for different departments.

Employee: is available throughout the week for flexible working hours, but has a set number of contract hours per week.

Planner: plans the work for the employee and tries to aim for the contract hours. Needs to keep track of every employee's minus hours or overtime. Bonus needs to keep track of the driving time of every driver as there are legal maximum standards.

Admin for Invoicing: Needs to check the hours worked by the employee and bill the client accordingly. Often these hours are different to what in reality has happend.

Admin for Payroling: Needs to check the hours worked by the employee and calculate CAO additions. Important data for that is: -the day -time on the day -Working outside the lockup -Working in the lockup -Start of a Staying overnight trip -Coming home from overnighttrip -intermediate day of overnight trip.

I will later perhaps add possibilities for time off, Sick leave, etc. for now lets get this working for these for groups.
